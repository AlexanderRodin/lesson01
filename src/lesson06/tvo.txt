If you believe an article about you or your organization is incomplete, inaccurate, or biased,
there are several avenues for you to discuss the issue with Wikipedia's editorial community.
Location of the talk page tab
Wikipedia does not have a centralised author or content reviewer,
and our content is maintained by volunteer editors. The people who have edited or who monitor your article are
probably the best first point of contact.
People who edit or monitor your article can be reached by leaving a note detailing your issues on the
article's "talk" page. This can be found by clicking the "talk" link at the top of your article.
Once you're there, click the "new section" tab to the right of that. This will create a new section, where you
can post your specific comments or concerns - put {{request edit}} at the top of your new section to indicate
your conflict of interest and ask for the edits to be done for you. Click "Publish page", and your new section
will be added immediately.
If leaving a message on the talk page does not help, you can leave a message at the help desk,
which is more frequently monitored.
Alternatively, you can reach other experienced volunteers by emailing info-en-q@wikimedia.org.
Please include the address or title of your article and specific information on the problems you have with it.
While your email will likely remain confidential, certain unforeseen circumstances, including but not limited to
security breaches, subpoenas, or leaks, might compromise that confidentiality. Note that while volunteers may
assist you in removing very bad data, they will not add new data for you - for such edits you need to use the
talk page as described above.
If you're interested in donating photographs to illustrate your article or adding a recording of your voice,
you can upload them yourself and include them in the article. Alternatively, you can email
photosubmission@wikimedia.org . Please include the photograph in question, along with a statement
that you own the copyright on it, and an agreement to release it under a free license.
Our recommended license is the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 license.
If you don't own the copyright, please ask the photographer or copyright owner to send in a release instead.
The "declaration of consent" may be used if desired.
