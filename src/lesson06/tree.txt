Do you want to use something you've found on Wikipedia? Wikipedia is a freely licensed encyclopedia;
most of our content can be copied and used for any purpose. The exception to this is content used as "fair use".
Fair use media is clearly identified if you go to the page about that file;
you should see that the file is identified as "fair use under United States copyright law.
Other uses of this image, on Wikipedia or elsewhere, might be copyright infringement" in the "Licensing" section.
Fair use text should be marked explicitly as a quotation.
All other content should be freely licensed and open for your use as long as you meet the licensing conditions.
For specifics, see our page on reusing Wikipedia content. We try hard to identify the sources and licenses of all
media such as text, images or sounds used in our encyclopedia articles.
Still, we cannot guarantee that all media are used or marked correctly.
If an image description page states that an image was in the public domain,
you should still check yourself whether that claim appears correct and decide for
yourself whether your use of the image would be acceptable under the laws applicable to you.
