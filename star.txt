The star is a massive self-luminous celestial body,
consisting of gas or plasma in which occur,
thermonuclear reactions have occurred or will occur.
The closest star to the Earth is the Sun, and the stars in the night sky look like points of different brightness,
retaining their relative position.
Stars differ in structure and chemical composition,
and parameters such as radius, mass and luminosity,
different stars may differ by orders of magnitude.
The most common classification scheme for stars - by spectral class - is based on their
temperature and luminosity. In addition, variable stars are distinguished among the stars,
binary or multiple systems, star clusters and galaxies. Over time the stars change their characteristics
since thermonuclear fusion takes place in their depths, as a result of which the chemical composition and mass change - this is
the phenomenon is called the evolution of stars, and depending on the initial mass of the star, it
can take place in completely different ways. The view of the starry sky has attracted people since antiquity,
myths and legends of different peoples were associated with the view of constellations or individual luminaries on it.
