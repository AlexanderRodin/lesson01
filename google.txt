Google is an American multinational corporation reorganized on October 15, 2015
in the international conglomerate Alphabet Inc., a company within the Alphabet holding investing
in internet search, cloud computing and advertising technologies.
Google maintains and develops a number of Internet services and products
(see: List of Google services and tools) and earns revenue primarily from advertising
through their Ads program. It is considered one of the big four technology companies
along with Amazon, Apple and Microsoft.
The company was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin.
It was first registered as a private company on January 4, 1996,
and on August 19, 2004, it began selling its shares on the stock market.
Then Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together at Google
for twenty years, until 2024. The declared mission of the company from the very
the beginning was "the organization of world information, making it accessible and useful for everyone",
and the unofficial slogan of the company, coined by Google engineer Paul Buckheit,
 - "Don't be evil." In 2003 the company moved to its current
 headquarters in Mountain View, California.
